# sfml_1
Laboratorio di programmazione - SFML &amp; A*

Interactive game in c++ and sfml library. A random maze is built and it is possible to move a character to reach and end point. 
The initial position of the character is random, but in an avaiable position (not on the wall). 
It has some extra features: pressing "a" on the keyboard will start a* algorithm and you will see that the character will find
the exit by itself.
